# file-structure
If you've been redirected from crates.io: this crate was renamed and then abandoned, so this name is available to use

If you want the name, please contact me and I'll transfer

Contact info updated at github.com/marcospb19/marcospb19

You can also create an issue at that readmed repo, and I'll answer your request if I'm still alive.
